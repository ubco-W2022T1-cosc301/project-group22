## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words


We hope to get some interesting information about some of our favourite video games from this project. Being able to compare them to popular games or see how they performed internationally should make this process exciting. Our interest in this dataset is rooted in an interest in video games each of us have. We all grew up playing and they have been a hobby that hasn't faded with age, which is extremely common among people our age. Video games have become a way to bring people together and make new friends, so they've really shaped us and our peers. Specifically with this dataset, we want to explore  trends in certain genres doing better than others and whether there's a relationship between sales and critic score. Building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset is definitely easy to imagine for us, especially since it will soon be a requirement. However we look forward to it and are optimistic about the things we'll do and learn with our dataset!

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words


The dataset was provided by none other than VGchartz and the ratings were provided by the famous website Metacritic. The dataset contains information of the video games such as their release date, sales in North America, sales in Japan, sales in Europe, sales in other continents, global sales, publishers, platform, critic score, critic count, developer, rating, the number of users, and the user scores. The dataset was collected from 1980 to December 22, 2016, although the specific date in 1980 is unspecified. The purpose of the dataset is to have fun and pursue our curiosity in video games. It's also to learn about different trends around video games such as how they can be publically recieved differently depending on the region, year of release, genre, etc.. It's also to learn information specifially about Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective for the Nintendo DS. The dataset was collected from multiple sources by a human, not a robot.
