## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words


We hope to get some interesting information about some of our favourite video games from this project. Being able to compare them to popular games or see how they performed internationally should make this process exciting. Our interest in this dataset is rooted in an interest in video games each of us have. We all grew up playing and they have been a hobby that hasn't faded with age, which is extremely common among people our age. Video games have become a way to bring people together and make new friends, so they've really shaped us and our peers. Specifically with this dataset, we want to explore  trends in certain genres doing better than others and whether there's a relationship between sales and critic score. Building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset is definitely easy to imagine for us, especially since it will soon be a requirement. However we look forward to it and are optimistic about the things we'll do and learn with our dataset!
